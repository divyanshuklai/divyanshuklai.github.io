                    <h3>What Went Right</h3>
                    <p>While the project wasn't a complete success, it was a great learning experience. Here are a few things that went as planned:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The LIDAR-based detection system was a good choice, it was more efficient than continuous video processing and helped keep the Raspberry Pi from overheating.</li>
                        <li>The metal MG995 servos were robust enough for the segregation mechanism, although they required a dedicated power supply.</li>
                        <li>A physical on/off switch was a small but useful addition.</li>
                        <li>I was able to reduce the latency to under 3 seconds by using a smaller model (EfficientNet), which was a good optimization.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What Went Wrong</h3>
                    <p>This project was a valuable lesson in the difference between theory and practice. Here are some of the key challenges and failures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The model's real-world performance was disappointing. It was heavily biased towards classifying everything as biodegradable due to a skewed dataset.</li>
                        <li>I spent a significant amount of time troubleshooting hardware issues, like getting the PiCamera to work through the terminal. This took time away from collecting a diverse and representative dataset.</li>
                        <li>The lack of a proper test set of images from the actual PiCamera meant that I didn't have a good way to evaluate the model's performance in a real-world scenario.</li>
                        <li>The online datasets I used for training didn't accurately represent the kind of waste the bin would encounter in reality.</li>
                    </ul>
